1.What is the tightest bound Big-O runtime of random_int_list()?
Please explain your answer (succinctly).
    - The tightest would be O(n) because it would break break down the number in a certain time frame. 
    - But as more numbers come into play, the longer it would take for the notation to break down and process the number 

2.  What is the tightest bound Big-O runtime of time_trial()?
    - The tightest bound runtime is O(n log n) because it is taking a fast time to do the searches compared to the others

3. 32

4. A class, a list, a dictionary
